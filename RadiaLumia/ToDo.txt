BASIC FUNCTION
- Motor Acceleration Function:
-   needs to be replicated in the simulation of Umbrellas
-   Probably needs Cameron and Peter for 30 minutes

SENSORS
- Test getting input to the new sensors cache in Sensors.pde
- Test Anemometer -> RadiaWindProtect Pattern
- Implement basic Pulley Umbrella Functionality - default 1-3 patterns that trigger when you pull an umbrella
- Implement programming the structure with specific combo's of pulling the umbrellas

ART HAUS
- Virtual Musicians
-    - Logic for weighted switching between patterns
-    - Will they offset by 1 or 2 beats from eachother?
- Write more patterns, that sync up with the tempo object
- Create intro, crescendo and daybreak patterns

PATTERNS
- Top Priority: Need Umbrella Patterns
- Need more color patterns
- Need more mask patterns
- Need more pinspot patterns
